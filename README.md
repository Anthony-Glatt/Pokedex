# Pokedex

> A react / mobx progressive web app

### Get Started

This project utilizes the package manager `yarn`

  Use `yarn` to install and update dependencies

  Use `yarn dev` to serve a local instance of the app at localhost:3000

### Styling

This project utilizes `scss` and `BEM`

  BEM stands for Block Element Modifier and is a methodology that helps you to achieve reusable components.

    `Block`
      Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.

      Examples: header, container, menu, checkbox, input

    `Element`
      A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block.

      Examples: menu item, list item, checkbox caption, header title

    `Modifier`
      A flag on a block or element. Use them to change appearance or behavior.

      Examples: disabled, highlighted, checked, fixed, size big, color yellow
